## 1、在线学习与离线学习

In offline learning, the whole training data must be available at the time of model training. Only when training is completed can the model be used for predicting.  	 	

In contrast, online algorithms process data sequentially. They produce a model and put it in operation without having the complete training dataset available at the beginning. The model is continuously updated during operation as more training data arrives.
